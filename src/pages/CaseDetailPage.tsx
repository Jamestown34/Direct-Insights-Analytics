  description: `
**Client**  
Spotter is a U.S.-based long-haul transportation company managing a large fleet across multiple states.

**Problem**  
The company faced growing repair costs and underutilized trucks. Without integrated analytics, they struggled to decide which trucks to keep, sell, or inspect â€” risking unnecessary spend and compliance issues.

**Solution**  
We built a data-driven fleet evaluation model using **Python + Excel Dashboarding**. The analysis integrated 6 internal datasets and Truck Paper listings to:
- Score every truck by maintenance, mileage, resale, and usage
- Recommend **Keep / Sell / Inspect**
- Export audit-ready reports with reasoning for each decision

ðŸ“· ![Fleet Dashboard](/images/cases/truck-eval.png)

**Results**  
- 102 trucks flagged for sale â€” $1.1M in avoidable repairs  
- 61 trucks validated to keep in rotation  
- 120 flagged for inspection due to data gaps or borderline metrics  
- Gave execs clear insight into fleet health in one glance

**Tools Used**
